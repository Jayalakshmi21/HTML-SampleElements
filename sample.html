        <strong>The School of Engineering</strong> (SOE) had a humble beginning in 1978 with a few post graduate and Ph.D. programs in Engineering. 
        Now, with over 3000 students, it has assumed a formidable size as the largest academic unit of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT),
        a State Govt. University accredited by <em>NAAC with A+ Grade</em> in October 2022. 
        In 1995, the School started B.Tech programs in four conventional disciplines, such as, Civil Engineering, 
        Mechanical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering,
        and a novel UG programme, Information Technology, for the first time in India. 
        In 1996, yet another novel UG programme, B.Tech in Safety and Fire Engineering, was introduced for the
        first time in the world.<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank"> reference </a> B.Tech program in Electrical and Electronics Engineering was added in 2003. 
        Currently, the nine Departments of the School offer 10 UG programmes, 11 PG programmes and PhD in most
        of the engineering disciplines serving all the stake-holders in the best way possible. The School has 
        executed projects worth more than Rupees 250 lakhs through its research and consultancy activities. 
        The School received Rs. 17 core under the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) 
        in Phase-II and Phase-III and modernized its research and other infrastructures.
